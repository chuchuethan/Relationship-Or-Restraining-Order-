# Relationship-Or-Restraining-Order?
A Corporate Romance Case Study

# Premise of this Project
My friend (we'll call them T) interned at Monster in summer 2025 (woo hoo!) and developed an infatuation with one of the other interns, (we'll call them J). On facetime T said that they needed to be studied and I took them up on the offer! During our facetimes / debriefs I would take notes and ask them questions to get them to think about their relationship with J.

In a way I was both a data collector and a pseudo-therapist! This project is overall very light, fun, and unserious (and also ongoing!). It was a very fun way to practice using Excel and Tableau!

# Privacy
For the sake of privacy, not ALL major events will be included, mainly the more technical parts of this project will be uploaded. And yes, I do have permission from my friend T to share this.

# Enjoy!
